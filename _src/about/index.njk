    <p class="lead">I'm a brainstormer and a problem solver.</p> 
    <p>As a designer, I work with stakeholders to identify their userbase, devise products that exceed expectations, and deliver them efficiently.</p>
    <p>I love working in a high-paced environment, juggling multiple projects, and maintaining high standards. I can manage expectations, develop relationships with clients and collaborators, and give and receive considerate criticism. Learning and developing my skills is always at the forefront of my process.</p>
